## Experiments

### RQ1 Does external Semantic fusion with uncertainty improves prediction?
* Do adding uncertain evidence reduce uncertainty?
* Different kinds of [evidence](https://cse.sc.edu/~mgv/csce582sp21/links/mradEtAl_APIN2015.pdf)
    * Hard evidence
    * Virtual evidence
    * Likelihood evidence
    * soft evidence
* Not all unreliable evidence follow the principle of adding reduces uncertainty.
* So the first question to answer is the different uncertainty coming from the different UE methods can these be summed ?



### RQ1 Comparison of output semantic fusion 

### Does semantic fusion help in computation reduction?

In this experiment we are looking at the tradeoff between accuracy and computation.

### efficiency-accuracy trade off
