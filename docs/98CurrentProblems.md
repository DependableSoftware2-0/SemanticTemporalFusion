# Issues/Problems


1. The baseline is single frame.
    - The baseline cannot be single frame
    - Its obvious knowledge, fusion should work better than single frame
    - We need a strong baseline.
    - some other fusion method who claim to perform better on a task.

2. Dataset is limited 
    - Semantic segmentation all papers are eith cityscapes, kitti or scannet
    - Need to do other dataset
    - For example = BOP datasets
