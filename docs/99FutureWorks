# Future works

1. CRF as RNN for fusion 
  - https://github.com/sadeepj/crfasrnn_pytorch/blob/master/crfasrnn/crfrnn.py
  - As per the code the n_iteration=5 can be replaced with 2 with our previous frame and next frame formulation
  - [Conditional Random Fields as Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03240.pdf)
  - Very important paper to understand CRF, how it can be converted to a rnn and the different methods to do it
  - Another implementation : https://github.com/migonch/crfseg/blob/master/crfseg/model.py
  - Waht is different about man field CRF
  
2. MRF conv for fusion 
  - Better than CRF as it requires iteration MRF conv doesnt require iterations 
  - https://liuziwei7.github.io/projects/DPN
  - No code available
