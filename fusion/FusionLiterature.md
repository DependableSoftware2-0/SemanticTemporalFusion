# Beleif fusion


1. Dempster Shafer fusion 
    - [A Python library for performing calculations in the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence.](https://github.com/reineking/pyds)
    - Support for normalized as well as unnormalized belief functions
    - Different Monte-Carlo algorithms for combining belief functions
    - Various methods related to the generalized Bayesian theorem
    - Measures of uncertainty
    - Methods for constructing belief functions from data
    - [Example of fusion with IRIS Dataset](http://bennycheung.github.io/dempster-shafer-theory-for-classification)

2. Bayesian Fusion with the library we had 
    - Use the Confusion matrix for Prior and 
    - P(A | A
