## Achieving higher accuracy with smaller models using temporal fusion  
Robots are embedded devices and with limited resources. There is lot of redundant temporal information. 
The redundant temporal information can be used to reduce the computation capability and produce high quality output for robots.



## Fault tolerant Semantic Segmentation: Exploiting System Knowledge

LEC are not reliable and give faulty outputs.
In robotics and autonomous systems the faults can cause reliability and safety risks.
Run time monitors are used to monitor the LEC and detect faulty outputs.
 

## Extending run time monitors to Fault tolerance using temporal fusion
Run time monitors are required for reliability and safety guarntes of LEC's . 
They continuously monitor the input/internals/output of the LEC and decide whether to use the output of the LEC
On the contrary in this work we explore the possibility of extending the capability of run-time monitors to do fault tolerance.
